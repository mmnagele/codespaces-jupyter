# Tic Tac Toe — Modern PySide6 App

This is a polished Tic Tac Toe GUI implemented with PySide6. Features:
- Beautiful gradient theme and rounded cells
- Two-player (PvP) and single-player (vs unbeatable AI using minimax)
- Restart and status display

Run:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python tictactoe/main.py
```

The app uses `PySide6` for the UI. If running inside a headless Codespace, the GUI won't display — run locally with an X server or on your desktop.
